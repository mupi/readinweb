				<span class="green">The Taj Mahal</span> is invariably included in the list of the world&lsquo;s foremost wonders. <span class="green">The building</span> is renowned both for its beauty and the love story that inspired its construction. It may be said that <span class="green">this tomb</span>, built in the small city of Afra in north central India, has no match upon earth, for mortal remains have never been housed in greater grandeur.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				The love story started in 1612, when <span class="red">Mumtaz Mahal</span>, <span class="red">a lovely young girl</span>, married <span class="blue">Shah Jehan</span> (then <span class="blue">Prince Khurram</span>). The marriage, although the <span class="blue">Prince</span>&lsquo;s second, was a true love match. <span class="red">The princess</span> joined <span class="red">her</span> <span class="red">husband</span> on all <span class="blue">his</span> journeys and military expeditions, as <span class="blue">his</span> comrade and counsellor. <span class="red">She</span> was also concerned with the weak and the needy, and <span class="red">she</span> inspired <span class="blue">the head of the nation</span> to acts of charity and benevolence. <span class="orange">The couple</span> lived happily for eighteen years and had fourteen children. Unfortunately, <span class="red">the empress</span> died giving birth to <span class="orange">their</span> fourteenth child, only three years after <span class="blue">Shah Jehan</span>&lsquo;s accession to the throne.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				Overpowered by grief, <span class="blue">the husband</span> decided to build <span class="blue">his</span> <span class="red">beloved wife</span> <span class="green">the finest sepulchre</span> ever as a way to perpetuate <span class="red">her</span> memory. This pious intention was supported by the people, who revered <span class="red">the empress</span> due to <span class="red">her</span> kindness and the sad circumstance of <span class="red">her</span> early death.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				Workmen were brought from all over Asia. Those who had the greatest abilities were hired. In 1632, over 20,000 men began <span class="green">the construction</span>. When it was finished, more than twenty years later, everyone agreed that it was <span class="green">the most beautiful mausoleum</span> in the world. <span class="blue">The emperor</span> was so pleased with <span class="green">the work of art</span> that <span class="blue">he</span> decided to build a matching <span class="green">one</span> across the river. However, <span class="blue">he</span> died before this could be done.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				Most people are not aware that <span class="green">the Taj Mahal</span> is not <span class="green">an isolated building</span>, but is part of a vast complex comprised of a main gateway, an elaborated garden, a mosque and a prayer house, outer enclosures and enclosing walls. <span class="green">The architectural beauty</span> rests on a platform of red sand stone. <span class="green">It</span> is made of fine white marble brought in from the far corners of the country. Many of the walls are inlaid with coloured marble and precious stones. Others are adorned with parts of the Koran - the ones that best represent the most cherished principles of the Muslim world. <span class="green">The Islamic architecture</span> has eight sides and many open arches. The visitor looks through carved marble screens to a central room that stands above a gallery. The former is the actual tomb where the bodies of <span class="blue">Shah Jehan</span> and <span class="red">Mumtaz Mahal</span> lie.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				A lovely garden surrounds <span class="green">the massive structure</span>. In front of the main entrance there is a long, narrow pool. The use of symmetrical patterns is evident in the relationship between sun and shade, plants and water. The effect is that of a Persian rug.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				Some people think <span class="green">the Taj Mahal</span> is most beautiful at sunset, when the tomb shines like a rose-colored crown. Others like <span class="green">it</span> best at noon when <span class="green">it</span> is a pure, cold white. Still others think <span class="green">it</span> should be seen by moonlight, when <span class="green">it</span> has a soft silver radiance. However, all agree that <span class="green">the Taj Mahal</span> is <span class="green">one of the most beautiful buildings</span> that have ever been built.
