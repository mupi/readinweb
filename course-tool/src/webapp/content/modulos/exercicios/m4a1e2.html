				 It is a common belief that 
				 <span id="p1" class="clicavel"><span class="pa1">older</span> <span class="pa2">people</span></span> 
				 frequently remember experiences from their early years very clearly, but have difficulty remembering recent events. 
				 <span id="p2" class="clicavel"><span class="pa1">Old</span> <span class="pa2">people</span></span> "live in the past", goes the argument, because they are unable to store or retrieve recent 
				 events as they age. But is this the real explanation?
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 Carol Holland of the University of Leeds and Patrick Rabbit of the University of Manchester believe 
				 <span id="p3" class="clicavel"><span class="pa1">elderly</span> <span class="pa2">people</span></span> who have lost their independence simply prefer to talk about 
				 early experiences, because their present lives are relatively uneventful (Psychology, vol. 82, p. 29).
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 The psychologists compared how two groups of 
				 <span id="p4" class="clicavel"><span class="pa1">elderly</span> <span class="pa2">volunteers</span></span> of equivalent age and general intelligence 
				 recalled events in their lives. Members of one group lived in residential care, while the others led independent lives.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 Holland and Rabbit found that people in residential care recalled more memories from their early lives than from their recent lives. 
				 They found the opposite in the 
				 <span id="p5" class="clicavel"><span class="pa3">independent</span> <span class="pa1">elderly</span></span>.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 The psychologists suggest that the people in residential care spend more time rehearsing earlier events. The 
				 <span id="p6" class="clicavel"><span class="pa3">"independent"</span> <span class="pa2">group</span></span> reported rehearsing early memories less often than recent memories. In contrast, 
				 <span id="p7" class="clicavel"><span class="pa2">people</span></span> in <span id="p8" class="clicavel"><span class="pa4">residential</span></span> care generally rehearsed early memories more often.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 The study reminds us that, in trying to understand ageing memory, it is not the sort of things that are remembered that is important, 
				 but why they are remembered. In residential care homes, reminiscence is actively encouraged by the staff and enjoyed by 
				 <span id="p9" class="clicavel"><span class="pa4">the residents</span></span>. It, therefore, serves a more useful function to them than to independent individuals.
