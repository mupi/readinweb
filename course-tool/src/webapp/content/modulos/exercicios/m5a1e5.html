					In traditional Brazilian culture, <span class="italic">violeiros</span> were considered distinguished persons and held distinguished positions in their communities. Viola music was greatly appreciated.
					<br/>
					Thus, the Knowledge of the <span class="italic">viola</span> was considered an important cultural heritage Fathers would pass their knowledge on to their sons and to others who were highly motivated to learn the secrets and subtleties of the instrument.
				</span>
				
				<br/>
				<span class="yellow1">
					In recent years, however, the value placed on the <span class="italic">viola</span> and its music has declined as a whole. This change in attitude can be traced to the process of industrialization and urbanization in Brazil.
					<br/>
					As people migrated to the cities from the countryside, they came to look dow upon the culture of the rural areas. <span class="italic">Viola</span> vocal music, with its themes of life in the country, was strongly associated with rural culture and therefore relegated to a position of inferiority.
					<br/>
					The rapid development of the communication network throughout the country also brought urban forms of music over the television and radioto all parts of Brazil, accelerating the decline of interest in rural music forms, such as <span class="italic">viola music</span> .
				</span>
				
				<br/>			
				
				<span class="yellow2">
					Thus, <span class="italic">violeiros</span> today have difficulty finding an audience that appreciates their music and the traditional rural lifestyle described in their songs. It is common to find people who uses the terms &ldquo;<span class="italic">caipira</span>&rdquo; and &rdquo;<span class="italic">violeiro</span>&ldquo; as terms with a belittling, or even

					pejorative, connotation. In an attempt to appeal to a broader audience these days, some <span class="italic">violeiros</span> have come to play fewer <span class="italic">toques</span>, the traditional rhythmic-melodic patterns, which they now call <span class="italic">toques antigos</span> (old toques), concentrating instead on contemporary pieces. In fact, they think that today&lsquo;s music is more pleasing to their audience than the mazurkas, the <span class="italic">marchinas</span> (little marches), the rural <span class="italic">sambas</span>, the <span class="italic">xotes</span>, the <span class="italic">rancheirinhas</span>, the <span class="italic">catira</span>, the <span class="italic">folias</span> - all genres of the repertoire they traditionally interpreted.
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="green">
					But now some audiences are discovering (or rediscovering) the <span class="italic">viola</span>, one of the most representative of the Brazilian folk instruments. Musically, it has tremendous potential. Its timbral richness is highly impressive and is variety of tunings allows for the creation of extremly harmonic fields. Some <span class="italic">viola</span>-players with training in classical music are attempting to promote the instrument and its repertoire, ass well as knowledge concerning the <span class="italic">viola</span>, so that it can find a larger and better informed audience.
					<br/>
					According to the Correa, Ideally, the repertoire performed on the <span class="italic">viola</span> should be specific to the instrument - not, for example, simply transcriptions of guitar music. Moreover, it should be linked both to traditional music, in terms of tuning and playing techniques, as well as to the performer&lsquo;s individual creativity.
